        "Propelled by the modern technological innovations, data is to this century what oil was to the previous one. Today, our world is parachuted by the gathering and disseminationof huge amounts of data. In fact, the International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that the total amount ofdigital data circulating annually around the world would sprout from 4.4 zettabytes in2013 to hit 180 zettabytes in 2025. Thatâ€™s a lot of data! With such a big amount of data circulating in the digital space, there is need to developmachine learning algorithms that can automatically shorten longer texts and deliveraccurate summaries that can fluently pass the intended messages. Furthermore, applying text summarization reduces reading time, accelerates the processof researching for information, and increases the amount of information that can fit inan area.(Ref: A Quick Introduction to Text Summarization in Machine Learning | by Dr. Michael J. Garbade | Towards Data Science)\n",

              "\"b'Long COVID is an often debilitating illness that occurs in at least 10% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\\\\xc2\\\\xa02 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. More than 200 symptoms have been identified with impacts on multiple organ systems. At least 65 million individuals worldwide are estimated to have long COVID, with cases increasing daily. Biomedical research has made substantial progress in identifying various pathophysiological changes and risk factors and in characterizing the illness; further, similarities with other viral-onset illnesses such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome have laid the groundwork for research in the field. In this Review, we explore the current literature and highlight key findings, the overlap with other conditions, the variable onset of symptoms, long COVID in children and the impact of vaccinations. Although these key findings are critical to understanding long COVID, current diagnostic and treatment options are insufficient, and clinical trials must be prioritized that address leading hypotheses. Additionally, to strengthen long COVID research, future studies must account for biases and SARS-CoV-2 testing issues, build on viral-onset research, be inclusive of marginalized populations and meaningfully engage patients throughout the research process. None Long COVID is a multisystemic illness encompassing ME/CFS, dysautonomia, impacts on multiple organ systems, and vascular and clotting abnormalities. It has already debilitated millions of individuals worldwide, and that number is continuing to grow. On the basis of more than 2 years of research on long COVID and decades of research on conditions such as ME/CFS, a significant proportion of individuals with long COVID may have lifelong disabilities if no action is taken. Diagnostic and treatment options are currently insufficient, and many clinical trials are urgently needed to rigorously test treatments that address hypothesized underlying biological mechanisms, including viral persistence, neuroinflammation, excessive blood clotting and autoimmunity.'\""
